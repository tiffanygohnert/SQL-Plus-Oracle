 SQL-Plus-Oracle
Oralce SQL Database Labs

Michael McLaughlin was my instructor at BYU-Idaho. He taught CIT 225. During these classes, we were required to pass complicated weekly labs, involving lots of different database skills, joins, and queries. Though these projects don't produce a specific service or product to display, it gives a good impression of the database skills that I acquired. It should be noted that my scripts passed 100% of all the unit test cases produced by the instructor. More information concerning the class labs can be found at Michael McLaughlin's blog: http://michaelmclaughlin.info/.
